# podscape-mcp

A standalone MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes your Kubernetes cluster as tools for AI assistants — Claude, Cursor, and any other MCP-compatible client.

Ask questions and make changes in plain language. No `kubectl` required.

## Build

```bash
cd go-core
go build ./cmd/podscape-mcp/
```

The binary is produced at `go-core/podscape-mcp`. Pre-built binaries for all platforms are available on every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/codingprotocols/podscape/releases/latest).

**Install a pre-built binary (macOS):**
```bash
# Apple Silicon
sudo curl -L https://github.com/codingprotocols/podscape/releases/latest/download/podscape-mcp-darwin-arm64 \
  -o /usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp

# Intel
sudo curl -L https://github.com/codingprotocols/podscape/releases/latest/download/podscape-mcp-darwin-amd64 \
  -o /usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp

# Clear Gatekeeper quarantine (unsigned binary)
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp
```

## Usage

```
podscape-mcp [--kubeconfig <path>]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--kubeconfig` | `~/.kube/config` | Path to kubeconfig file |

Kubeconfig resolution order: `--kubeconfig` flag → `$KUBECONFIG` → `~/.kube/config`.

The server communicates over `stdio` and is started automatically by your MCP client — you don't run it manually.

## Configuring your AI assistant

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Installed binary
claude mcp add --transport stdio podscape -- /usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp

# During development — point at the locally built binary
claude mcp add --transport stdio podscape -- $(pwd)/go-core/podscape-mcp
```

After adding, start a **new Claude Code session** — MCP servers connect on startup:
```bash
claude
```

Verify inside the new session:
```
/mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "podscape": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/podscape-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

`.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "podscape": {
      "command": "podscape-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```
